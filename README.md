# API-Challenge

The code runs exactly as promised. To summarize, I was tasked with fabricating latitude and longitude plots to create a list of cities.
I then used this data to obtain a few bits of information from a weather API, then chart them versus Latitude. 

The second assignment was to take the dataframe we generated in the last sheet, and impose information over Google Maps while querying their API for more. I created
a list of my ideal living conditions and then found hotels near the areas that presented with those conditions. I superimposed the points onto a humidity heat map which was required and that was that!
